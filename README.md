   If your device has windows or linux, head to our release page and download the CenoraWIN.zip if you are on Windows and CenoraLIN.zip if you are on Linux.\
   Once you extract it click the cenora file in any file manager you are in, then fullscreen it (optional) if you want it to fully take over as the UI.
